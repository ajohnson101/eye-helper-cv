OT_res_README
=============
- Descriptions of the contents in this subfolder for your edification!

####compare_kpd_plots (deprecated)
- plots and pickles for things generated with compare_kpd.py (in the OT folder)
- fullsize_plots: plots that compare trials for a particular method (distance from center, total keypoints, correct keypoints)
- initial_testing_plots: first attempts at visualization. some of the formatting on these plots may be off.
- method_comparison_plots: accuracy and dfc plots for the cookie trials; featured in the ipython notebook 'preliminary statistics adventures'. probably the most meaningful plots in the compare_kpd_plots folder.
- perc_correct_plots: percent correct plots for the cookie and cereal dataset; each plot features a different method

####cookie_dfc_plots (useful in preliminary statistics adventures)
- distance from center plots for the cookie trials. gaussian filter with sigma=2 was applied to facilitate better visualization. used in the preliminary statistics adventures; and a copy of these images is also in that ipython notebook's folder. 

####KP_detect_t_imgs (deprecated)
- training images (made by cropping in GIMP) ; these were used when we didn't use ground truth values for training image guidelines. probably deprecated. 

####KP_match (deprecated)
- screenshots from webcame adventures with CMT.py (consensus-based matching)

####kp_pickles (useful for the cookie, cereal, and catfood datasets)
- for when we decided to just generate all the keypoints once and put them into pickles for future use. :) definitely a timesaver.

####pickles_day30 (deprecated)
- pickled the results from day 30 work (see blog post for deets)

####plots_day30 (deprecated)
- plots of that day 30 work.
