=============

Prototyping computer vision/crowdsourcing features for an assistive technology project 

##### Working with OpenCV 
- HSV object tracking (At first glance, it's not the best for multi-color objects)
- Contour detection (Seems promising, need to demystify the math a bit and test on grocery store items)
